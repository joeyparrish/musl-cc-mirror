# Partial Mirror of musl.cc

Partial mirror of musl.cc to offload GitHub traffic from the main site.

GitHub Actions workflows can use this site instead of https://musl.cc/

## Status

This is a partial mirror of musl.cc that contains just the things I need for my
projects right now.  I did not create a full mirror because I didn't want to
stress the main site by mass-downloading without permission.  There is also a
1GB limit in GitHub Pages, but about 9GB of content on musl.cc.


## Future

Not sure where to go next.  A full mirror for GitHub's use is still needed.
Cloud storage will cost somebody a lot of money for bandwidth.  Ideally, a cloud
provider who depends on OSS would donate some credit to host it for many years.
