# Mirror of musl.cc

Proof of concept mirror of musl.cc to offload GitHub traffic from the main site.

GitHub Actions workflows can use this site instead of https://musl.cc/

## Status

This is a partial mirror of musl.cc that contains just the things I need for my
projects right now.  I did not create a full mirror because I didn't want to
stress the main site by mass-downloading without permission.


## Future

If this is approved by musl.cc as a solution, I will complete the mirror, help
build automation to keep it current, then turn the repo over to the musl team
to own.
